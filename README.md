Hypothesis: There are genes, or perhaps classes of genes, that are better positioned than others to mutate into something functional, and these involve changes at splice sites.  These genes require less mutations, or ‘evolutionary activation energy’, to create new, foldable proteins.
## To-do List
* Program that finds all possible **point mutations** that can change the **splicing pattern** of a gene
